This project focuses on forecasting water consumption using Linear Regression. The model is built with Python and scikit-learn, leveraging historical consumption data along with temporal and regional features.
 Project Overview

Forecast future water consumption trends.

Helps in sustainable water resource management.

Uses Machine Learning (Linear Regression) for prediction.

Dataset includes date, region, and water consumption details.

Files in Repository

Water demand forecasting week1.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with code.

water_consumption_forecasting.csv – Dataset used for training/testing.

water_consumption_model.pkl – Trained ML model saved using Joblib.

README.md – Project documentation (this file).

 Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-demand-forecasting.git
cd water-demand-forecasting


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib

How to Run

Place your dataset in the project folder.

Run the notebook or Python script:

python water_forecasting.py


The model will:

Train on historical data

Predict water demand

Save the trained model as water_consumption_model.pkl

 Results

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Visualization:
The notebook generates a plot comparing Actual vs Predicted Consumption.

 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas – Data preprocessing

Matplotlib – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Joblib – Model persistence

 Future Improvements

Try advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM.

Add external factors (temperature, rainfall, population).

Deploy the model as a web app (Flask/Streamlit).
